# Snake and Apple Game

Building snake and apple game in pygame and python

Snake and apple game is a simple game where snake moves in particular direction automatically, and when snake eats an apple it gets longer and your score increases.

While in the process of increasing length, speed of the snake also increases at certain lengths.

If snake hits any part of its body, it will die and game will over.

If snake moves away from the screen boundaries i.e. If snake hits any part of the wall, then snake will die and game will over.

When game is over, then you can again play the game by pressing enter.
